          <h2 class="h2">About Myself:</h2>
          <p>
            In 2011 I graduated from St.-Petersburg Mining University with a degree in Automation and Control with a 
            bachelor’s degree.
            <br>
            From 2011 to 2013 I worked as an engineer at Vitek-Avtomatika LLC. As a result of my professional 
            activities, I received an international certificate as an assistant developer in the LabVIEW software 
            product and practical experience in working with automated information-measuring systems.
            <br>        
            In 2013, I received a master’s degree from the National Mineral and Raw Materials University “Gorny”
             at the Department of Automation of Technological Processes and Production.
            <br>
            From 2014 to the present time, I have been working as an assistant at the Department of Automation
             of Technological Processes and Production.
            <br>
            In 2015 I defended Ph.D. thesis at the National Mineral and Raw Materials University “Gorny”.
            <br>
            From 2018 to the present I have been working as an associate professor at the Department of 
            Automation of Technological Processes and Production.
            <br>
            From 2020 to the present I have been working as a Lead Scientist of Research and Educational 
            Center for Digital Technologies.
